Dear sir,
I am sorry for contacting you through this medium without any previous
notice. I am a senior staff with Ghana National Petroleum
Corporation, (GNPC). My colleagues and I intentionally over-invoiced
a contract award to the tune of (USD 7.5.M) The principal contractor has
been fully paid remaining the over-invoiced sum. By virtue of our
civil service code of conduct, serving officers are not allowed to
operate foreign bank accounts. This is the more reasons why this
contact is made to you so that you will be fronted as a subcontractor
to the principal contractor whose contract fund still floats unpaid.

All internal arrangements have been beefed to transfer the fund into
the foreign account which you will supply to me for our mutual
benefits. Please indicate your interest via fax or email hence other
modalities will be discussed. There is no risk involved since the
process of transfer of the fund will observe legal documentation.

Most importantly please treat with utmost confidentiality.
