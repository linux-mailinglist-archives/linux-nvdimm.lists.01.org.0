I agree with Michal. This has been raised by different
people already, including on LWN (https://lwn.net/Articles/835342/).

I can follow Mike's reasoning (man page), and I am also fine if there is
a valid reason. However, IMHO the basic description seems to match quite good:

        memfd_create() creates an anonymous file and returns a file descriptor that refers to it.  The
        file behaves like a regular file, and so can be modified, truncated, memory-mapped, and so on.
        However,  unlike a regular file, it lives in RAM and has a volatile backing storage.  Once all
        references to the file are dropped, it is automatically released.  Anonymous  memory  is  used
        for  all  backing pages of the file.  Therefore, files created by memfd_create() have the same
        semantics as other anonymous memory allocations such as those allocated using mmap(2) with the
        MAP_ANONYMOUS flag.

AFAIKS, we would need MFD_SECRET and disallow
MFD_ALLOW_SEALING and MFD_HUGETLB.

In addition, we could add MFD_SECRET_NEVER_MAP, which could disallow any kind of
temporary mappings (eor migration). TBC.

Some random thoughts regarding files.

What is the page size of secretmem memory? Sometimes we use huge pages,
sometimes we fallback to 4k pages. So I assume huge pages in general?

What are semantics of MADV()/FALLOCATE() etc on such files?
I assume PUNCH_HOLE fails in a nice way? does it work?

Does mremap()/mremap(FIXED) work/is it blocked?

Does mprotect() fail in a nice way?

Is userfaultfd() properly fenced? Or does it even work (doubt)?

How does it behave if I mmap(FIXED) something in between?
In which granularity can I do that (->page-size?)?

What are other granularity restrictions (->page size)?

Don't want to open a big discussion here, just some random thoughts.
Maybe it has all been already figured out and most of the answers
above are "Fails with -EINVAL".
