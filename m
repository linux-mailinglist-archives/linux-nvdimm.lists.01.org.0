Hello,

I hope you had a good day.
I wish to present this business proposal to you for your due consideration, While skepticism on your part may be well understood due to the insecurities that abound in the Internet since I haven't had the chance to meet you yet to discuss in person but hope you are not offended but I could at least feel good if we have the same mindset to achieve this goal with the utmost discretion. This has been a very difficult decision to make considering the immediate burden under the circumstance we cannot waste time to ensure more responsive planning to transfer the sum of ($7,597,000.00) to your country for investment but If you are not willing, I'd greatly appreciate any referrals that you can provide and can rest assured, your help will be greatly rewarded.
In any event, a reply to this will be very much appreciated.

Chris Abim
