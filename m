Greetings to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Please do not view my plea as a contrived plot.My trusted family attorney=
 who would have executed my WILL & TESTAMENT on my behalf died<br>
early this year after a brief illness.I therefore prayed fervently and by=
 the special grace of GOD,i was led to you.I am Mrs Kimberly Cloud,from<b=
r>
United Kingdom,I am 62 years old. I am suffering from cancer of the lungs=
 and it has affected part of my brain cells due to<br>
complications.My condition is deteriorating and according to my doctors i=
 may not be alive in the next couple of months,unless there<br>
is a divine intervention.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was orphaned as a child and got married to late Engineer.Steve Louis fo=
r twenty years without having an offspring.My late husband had<br>
chronic cardiovascular condition and died of cardiac arrest few years ago=
.Steve and I lived in Nigeria for over 18 years,where my husband a<br>
petrochemical engineer by profession worked and rose through the ranks an=
d became an executive director in a multinational oil servicing and<br>
exploration conglomerate, before his untimely death.He also established h=
uge private investments that i supervised before his<br>
death and which forms the major source of our fortune.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Consequent upon the shocking demise of my priceless husband, i opted as a=
 rule, not to re-marry. When medical reports revealed that my<br>
cancer ailment have become terminal & more so because i do not have a dir=
ect next of kin to bequeath all that STEVE & I labored for,i sold<br>
off all our choice assets,landed properties and other valuable family tre=
asures and deposited the proceeds amounting to USD$10,000,000.00<br>
(TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONLY) with Uba Bank plc. The management of the bank =
has written me as the sole beneficiary of the fund because of the unservi=
ceable status of the fund over the years and suggested to me in a 2 parag=
raph statement to issue a letter of authorization to someone who can mana=
ge the fund on my behalf because of my terminal illness and also threaten=
ed that the fund could be confiscated upon my failure to adhere to their =
rules and regulations s clearly spelt out in their code of conduct.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am on admission at the intensive care unit of a London hospital,located=
 at Fulham road in west London United Kingdom. It is<br>
the leading cancer treatment hospital in the world.I am currently undergo=
ing treatment there for late-stage terminal cancer of the<br>
lungs. I am computer literate, I rarely talk but has my personal laptop w=
ith me and has the permission of my physicians to use it,hence<br>
I am writing from my sick bed in the (ICU).It is my last WISH that 85% of=
 this fund is invested substantially in any charitable organization<br>
of your choice and administered as you may deem fit,especially to the orp=
hanage homes.You are at liberty to also donate part of the funds to<br>
churches and mosques and to those struck by natural disaster.I have earma=
rked 5% of the total fund to run cost of administration of WILL &<br>
TESTAMENT and also on logistics and other sundry arrangements that you ma=
y require.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I crave your indulgence as a God fearing individual that equally has high=
 moral pedestal and who is also an uncommon humanitarian that<br>
cares so much about the plight of the less-privileged as much as i do, to=
 take it upon yourself and use this fund for the above mentioned<br>
purposes. This is a painstaking decision i have taken in other to help hu=
manity in my little capacity as a people driven entrepreneur and a<br>
very God fearing woman before i bow to God's sovereignty.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note that as soon as I receive your reply and personal information as lis=
ted below, I shall avail you with the official contact information<br>
of the Uba Bank plc officials,to enable you contact the Bank without dela=
ys.I will also issue you with an official letter of authorization,so that=
 my bankers will recognize your status as the new beneficiary of my ESTAT=
E, FUND, WILL & TESTAMENT. Interestingly 10% of the total sum is set asid=
e as your compensation for accepting to play this significant role for me=
 and i hope you will appreciate my kind<br>
gesture.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me remind you that the fund has an open beneficiary mandate and as su=
ch,it is whom i personally authorize or appoint to act on my behalf<br>
that the bank will ultimately recognize and release the funds to and by t=
his memo,the onus has fallen on you to assume this selfless and<br>
noble responsibility that will catalyze change by exploring and promoting=
 the development of new interventions that will benefit the<br>
poorest of the poor when the fund is transferred into your bank<br>
account.<br>
<br>
<br>

will consciously yield my bequest continued existence.<br>
