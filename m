Good Day.

I know reading my email, will be surprising to you and your 
entire family, but please take whatever I am about to share with 
you today seriously. 

My name is John Mobutu, I am 22 years old, from Congo, my parents 
were assassinated by opposition leaders many years ago, but thank 
God the United Nations Peace Keeping, who came to rescue me and 
my younger sister to Kenya, where we have been living presently. 

My late father was into Gold and Diamond mining, while my late 
mother was a Government worker. 

My four consignment boxes containing 182 Million USD and 2,300 
kilogram of gold was ship to the United Sates of America, three 
weeks ago for delivery to Mr. Barry  Miller, in Atlanta Ga, by 
the United Nations Head Office in Africa, which is in Kenya, but 
up till now the agents haven't been able to reach my beneficiary 
and they are threatening to return my money and gold back to 
Kenya, I am very disappointed and confuse right now, this is pure 
evil.

Please I really need your assistance right now, if you are 
willing to help us, kindly get back to us immediately for more 
discussion.

Please kindly tell us more about yourself when replying to our 
email. Thanks

God bless you

Sincerely 
John
