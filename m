That just requires a flag when gaining the layout lease to say it is
an "unbreakable layout lease". That gives the kernel the information
needed to determine whether it should attempt to break the lease on
truncate or just return ETXTBSY....

i.e. it allows gup-pinning applications that want to behave nicely
with other users to drop their gup pins and release the lease when
something else wants to truncate/hole punch the file rather than
have truncate return an error. e.g. to allow apps to cleanly interop
with other breakable layout leases (e.g. pNFS) on the same
filesystem.

FWIW, I'd also like to see the "truncate fails when unbreakable
layout lease is held" behaviour to be common across all
filesystem/storage types, not be confined to DAX only. i.e. truncate
should return ETXTBSY when an unbreakable layout lease is held
by an application, not just when "DAX+gup-pinned" is triggered....

Whatever we decide, the behaviour of truncate et al needs to be
predictable, consistent and easily discoverable...

Cheers,

Dave.
