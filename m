<br>MY REGARDS TO YOU,<br>

<br>Hello Beloved, How are you coping with this Covid-19 Pandemic? I know=
 this email might come to you as a surprise as we have not met before but=
 I believe God knows why he has directed me to you at this point in time.=
<br>

<br>My name is Mr. John Thomas, I`m a Branch Manager of a Financial insti=
tute , I am writing to solicit your assistance in the transfer of US$12,5=
00,000.00 Dollars. This fund is the excess of what my branch in which I a=
m the manager made as profit last year (i.e. 2020 financial year). I have=
 already submitted an annual report for this December to my head office i=
n Accra-Ghana as I have watched with keen interest as they will never kno=
w of this excess of the fund. I have since placed this amount of US$12,50=
0,000.00 Dollars<br>

<br>on an Escrow Coded account without a beneficiary (Anonymous) to avoid=
 trace. As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this=
 money thus I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this =
money into your bank account on my behalf. I agree that 40% of this money=
 will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a f=
oreign account, and 60% would be for me. I do need to stress that there i=
s practically no risk involved in this.<br>

<br>Best Regards<br>
<br>John Kofi Thomas,<br>
