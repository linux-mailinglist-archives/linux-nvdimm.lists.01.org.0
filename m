Hello!

As you may have noticed, I sent you an email from your account.
This means that I have full access to your device.

I've been watching you for a few months now.
The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site tha=
t you visited.

If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other de=
vice.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera a=
nd microphone, but you do not know about it.

I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.

Why your antivirus did not detect malware?
Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours=
 so that your antivirus is silent.

I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the s=
creen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched.
With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and=
 contacts on social networks.
I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers t=
hat you use.

If you want to prevent this,
transfer the amount of $777 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how=
 to do this, write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").

My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 14wJMVaw6GuMo64RB4HwfuhSraX8UmUxEU

After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never h=
ear me again.
I give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay.
I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see=
 this letter.

Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email canno=
t be tracked like my bitcoin address.
I do not make any mistakes.

If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video =
will be immediately distributed.

Best regards!
