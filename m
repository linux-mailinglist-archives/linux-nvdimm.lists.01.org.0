<p><font face="Arial">Dear Sir/Ma,<br>
<br>
<br>
$150 MILLION USD FROM WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DIVERTED AND READY TO BE 
CLAIMED.<br>
<br>
Greetings to you and happy new year 2021. Please take few minutes of your time 
to read this.<br>
<br>
My name is Mr. Anthony Ray Chavis from North Carolina USA, I Currently work with 
the<br>
World Health Organization (W.H.O) United Kingdom office and have been with them 
for<br>
many years moving from one country to another which has made me one of the top 
people<br>
in the organization.<br>
<br>
You are aware of the recent outbreak of Corona Virus Pandemic which started from 
Wuhan<br>
in China and escalated all over the world which lead to shutdown of many 
countries by<br>
the Government. I am happy that as at today many Government have started 
reopening their<br>
Country for work and businesses.<br>
<br>
Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, Billions of Dollars came in to World 
Health<br>
Organization as donated by individuals, Companies and Countries for the purpose 
of<br>
curbing and containing the deadly corona virus.<br>
<br>
<br>
I happen to head one of the department in charge of this funds and since last 
year I have<br>
carefully and perfectly cut out the amount of One Hundred and Fifty Million 
United States<br>
Dollars. ($150,000,000. USD). This amount has been deleted from our Database and 
included<br>
in the office file as part of the fund moved out to be disbursed to some 
Countries as<br>
Palliatives.<br>
<br>
I have masterfully planned this out in a way that no traces will be found now 
and forever.<br>
What I did is to divert the $150,000,000.USD to a safe place pending when I have 
a good<br>
partner to claim the fund. Due to the fact that we are always being monitor 
along with our<br>
family members this is why I started searching on the for someone who will be 
capable to<br>
stand in the place to receive the fund as a representative to his/her country.<br>
I will like to work with someone like you because you have a good profile.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This is real, legitimate and will not put you and I in any problem. I will guide 
you properly<br>
till you have received the fund, but you must make sure no one knows about this 
deal between<br>
you and I. After receiving the fund we shall share the fund equally between us.<br>
<br>
I will tell you more about this immediately I receive your response with your 
details,<br>
kindly reconfirm to me your full details as follows:<br>
FULL NAMES....&nbsp;<br>
ADDRESS....&nbsp;<br>
DATE OF BIRTH....<br>
GENDER....<br>
MARITAL STATUS....<br>
PHONE NUMBERS....<br>
OCCUPATION....<br>
ALTERNATIVE EMAIL ADDRESS....<br>
ATTACH COPY OF YOUR ID.<br>
<br>
This is a good opportunity that only comes once in a lifetime therefore we must 
make good use<br>
of it in this new year.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kind regards,<br>
