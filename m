If you kill the allocating process then yes, it would work, but your
process might be the very last to be selected.

This is an unexpected runtime error. Unless you make it an integral part
of the API design.

Yes it can fail. But it would fail at the mmap time when the reservation
fails. Not during the #PF time which can be at any time.

I am sorry but I am really fighting to find time to watch for all the

I would still like to understand whether that data is actually
representative. With some underlying reasoning rather than I have run
these XYZ benchmarks and numbers do not look terrible.

Well, as soon as this is a scarce resource then an access control seems
like a first thing to think of. Maybe it is not really necessary but
then this should be really justified.

I am also still not sure why this whole thing is not just a
ramdisk/ramfs which happens to unmap its pages from the direct
map. Wouldn't that be a much more easier model to work with? You would
get an access control for free as well.
