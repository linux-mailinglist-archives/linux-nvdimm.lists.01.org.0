I don't think many are...  I think most would effectively be "killed" if this
happened to them.

I'd really like to avoid this as well.  I think it will be very confusing for
RDMA apps to have their context suddenly be invalid.  I think if we have a way
for admins to ID who is pinning a file the admin can take more appropriate
action on those processes.   Up to and including killing the process.
