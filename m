Hello!

I'm a member of an international hacker group.

As you could probably have guessed, your account linux-nvdimm@lists.01.org was hacked, because as I messaged you from your account.
On moment of infection linux-nvdimm@lists.01.org was this password: 

Within a period from November 24, 2018 to May 14, 2019, you were infected by the virus we've created, through an adult website you've visited.
So far, we have access to your messages, social media accounts, and messengers.
Moreover, we've gotten full dumps of these data.

We are aware of your little and big secrets...yeah, you do have that. We saw and recorded your doings on porn websites.
Your tastes are so weird, you know..

But the key thing is that sometimes we recorded you with your webcam, syncing the recordings with what you watched!
I think you are not interested show this video to your friends, relatives, and your intimate one...

Transfer $773 to my Bitcoin wallet: 1DMnzmuVegUZhrWsEqxRZyw63u1vF5NXF5
I guarantee that after that, we'll erase all your "data"!

A timer will start once you read this message. You have 48 hours to pay the above-mentioned amount.

Your data will be erased once the money are transferred.
If you do not pay, all dumps of your messages and videos recorded will be automatically sent to all your contacts found on your devices for this moment.
Also, the operating system of your device will be suspended.

You should always think about your security. We hope this case will teach you to keep your secrets.

Bye!
