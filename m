Dear Friend,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
My name is Mrs.Lisa Green levan from Lativa but hospitalized in Spain for now due to ill health that has eaten deep on me for over 2 years ,I am suffering from a long time cancer of the breast coupled with very high blood pressure and Asthma ,from all indication my conditions is really deteriorating and it is quite obvious according to my doctors that I may not live for the next six months according to the expertise test carried on me, there is nothing else according them medically to save me I was married to my husband Mr Louis Obrien Levan for twelve years though he is deceased now as a result of liver malfunctions and my only son who would have taken the position of the Next of kin/Heir died one month ago because he was a sickle cell patient from birth .My husband was working in a an oil company company in Saudi Arabia as </DIV>
<DIV>
an Engineer before he won a contract with the shell company in Netherlands before died as a result of the liver problem.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Since his death I have never known peace because my late husband's brothers are after what he left behind which he sincerely WILLED to me , because of the unknown hence my health has so much deteriorated to a hopeless condition I decided to sale all my inherited belongings including funds and deposited all which came up to the sum of $10 million British Pounds Sterling with a Bank in Europe..</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Presently, I am in Spain and this money is still with the Bank in Europe.Recently the management of the bank notified me to come forward and claim my funds because it has overstayed or rather issue a Letter of Authorization to someone I trust to receive it on my behalf since I cannot come over because of my illness or the Government of the Country where the funds are&nbsp; will likely confiscate the funds according to their laws.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Presently I have access to a laptop which belongs to one of the Medical Doctors handling my health case in Spain which made it possible to reach you for this co-operations .</DIV>
<DIV>
In view of this and not knowing what could happen tomorrow I am afraid of leaving this funds in the hands of my husbands wicked relations or the bank where it is deposited hence It is my last wish to see that this money is invested to any organization of your choice with Muslim or Christian affiliation and distributed each year among the charity organization, the poor and the motherless babies home.Having perceived that you are a God fearing person after praying to God to direct me to a trust worthy person , I want you also use this money to fund orphanages and widows, I took this decision, before I rest in peace because my time will soon be up.As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank in Europe for the process of this transfer. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the new beneficiary of my fund.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
