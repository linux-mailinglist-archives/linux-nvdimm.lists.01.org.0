Dear Friend

How are you today? I pray this email finds you well. My name is Adams Jesse Cook and right now I am on a business trip in Malaysia,  I reside in the London, United Kingdom and I am a family lawyer to late Carl D. ?kerhielm.  Carl D. ?kerhielm and his wife has a terminal disease, Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and breast cancer which gradually terminated their lives, Carl D. ?kerhielm died 8 years ago why his wife died three and a half year ago

Before the death of Carl D. ?kerhielm and Marie-Louise ?kerhielm, they told me they do not know their biological parents as both grew up in a motherless home in Sweden before they planned and moved to France from France to London, where they met me, and they got a good job and finally married to each other, but unfortunately they were childless.

The deceased clients life savings GBP12,500,000.00 was deposited in one of the London banks, and on searching for the deceased relatives when the bank is threatening to confiscate the funds I discovered the next of kin was a reverend sister that all of them grew up in a motherless home and she was dead two years ago and since I have all the documents and the late next of kin have the same surname with you that is why I am contacting you if such a deal is not against your wish reply and I will guide you on how to apply for the claim, and we will work together on how to obtain all the documents in your favour.

Method of sharing the fund, 50/50, that is equal percentage ratios. Please feel very free to ask question/s. Note, upon your cooperation, 3 to 5 official working days consider the funds transfer and credited into your local bank account .

I will be very glad to read from you ASAP.

Yours faithfully
Adams Jesse Cook, Legal practitioner
