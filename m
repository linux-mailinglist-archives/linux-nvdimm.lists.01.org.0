 My sincere apology for invading into your privacy  for this proposal

  My Name is Sr Agueda Aloisio I am from Portugal I have been diagnosed
with cancer.

  It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only
about a few months to live, according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for
anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was
never generous; I was always hostile to People and only focused on my
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all
this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or
make all the money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would
live my life a different way from how I have lived it.

my chances of survival is not up to %5 according to Doctor but i am not
afraid because I know the will of God will be done.

  I would want to have a Personal and Trustworthy Relationship with you, as
I intend and willing to empower the change of ownership for the transfer
of my Deposits to your personal possession for further Investment and
Charity Disbursement to the Less Privilege and Homeless
My wife run away with my wealth and got married to my personal attorney.

I will send you the photos of me in the hospital, including my ex-raw scan,
Thank you for your due consideration. God be with you .

More details and things that i need to explain and send to you regarding
this charity project cannot be sent here and i can only send via email,
that is the reason why i said you should contact me on my email.

I may Not return here to communicate with you, but i will be waiting for
your feedback on my email. carmanllapointe44@gmail.com

Yours Brother.

Sr Agueda Aloisio
