Hello,

Good day, please accept my apology for sending you this sensitive 
information without per informing you. This is due to the urgency 
of the information. I am a Project director at Ghana  National 
Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and a member of Contract Tenders 
Board of the Ministry of Mineral Resources in Ghana. I need your 
service in a confidential matter regarding money transfer from an 
over-invoiced contract sum. This requires a private arrangement 
though the details of the transaction will be furnished to you if 
you indicate your interest in this proposal. We have all the 
legal documents to back up the transaction, besides we have 
worked out the modalities to ensure smooth conclusion of this 
fund transfer. We  are willing to offer you 25% and there is not 
risk involved in the transaction.

I am expecting to hear from you, if you have interest in the 
business. In which case, correspondence in the course of the 
transaction will be conducted by email presently.

Thanks,
Yours Faithfully,
Dr. Joseph Dabantu
