Hello Dear=A0 Partner,
CONFIDENTIAL OFFER REGARDING CRUDE OIL
LIFTING CONTRACT.
CRUDE OIL LIFTING LICENSE NO: ANP-C-STP/056432.
Reply Email:engr.franciscopinto1955@gmail.com

This is a
confidential business offer from the oil rich Sao Tome and Principe.=A0
Please ensure that you reply this email strictly at
:engr.franciscopinto1955@gmail.com

I make this introduction
based on my regard for your credibility. My name is Engr. Francisco Pinto.
I work with the Sao Tome and Principe national petroleum agency. To be
precise, I oversee the issuance of oil allocation license for our oil
company. My position in the agency entitles me to recommend oil allocation
bidders and actualize oil lifting and exploration allocation licenses to
my candidates based on my interest. I also oversee and approve the
issuance of the license for oil allocation in our company and also monitor
the lifting procedures in our company.
=A0
In June 2007, I
facilitated and actualized the license of a candidate. A business man from
Korea (Comprehensive details to be provided subsequently). The license was
for 1 year at 24 million BBLS/12 months. Incidentally the candidate was no
more. The license has been valid till date (as I always ensure that I keep
to my side of the bargain), I have decided to begin using the license from
JANUARY. I am in need of a partner from your country whom I can trust. I
will package this partner as the allocation license beneficiary and assign
the license to this partner. Due to my position in the petroleum agency, I
cannot handle this position. Your profile fits into the criteria of a
partner I need. This is why I am contacting you. With the trend of events
in Sao Tome and Principe, we shall be able to lift a minimum of 400,000
barrels of BLCO per month. This will fetch us an average of US$28 million
per month. And we have from JANUARY 2020 up until JANUARY=A0 2021 to
lift crude oil which will fetch us approximately (12) x (28) Million
dollars. This is approximately 336 Million dollars for the rest of the
time of the license allocation.=A0 I have ready buyers who are waiting
and would be ready to scramble for any number of barrels we lift. Also, I
will oversee all lifting procedures with the available mercenary
around.

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0

=A0THIS IS WHAT I PROPOSE.

{1} Your Company profile
shall be used in place of the initial license Operator. This I shall
handle with my capacity in the company.
{2} I will ensure that your
company's profile is recognized as the current license operator and that
we have a mandate for at least min of 400,000 barrels per month, a maximum
of 500,000 barrels per month. Starting from JANUARY.
{3}I will ensure
that all lifting procedures are in place and buyers readily available to
purchase the product.
{4} You shall stand in as the license operator
for all lifting and sales transactions; we shall open an account for the
receipt of the oil sale proceeds in which both of us shall be signatories
to the account or you can provide your personal or company bank account to
receive the payments on our behalf.
{5} We shall split the oil sale
proceeds in the ratio of 60:40 equity shares. I shall be entitled to 60%
share while your company shall be entitled to 40% share.

Please
note: no third-party arrangement shall be allowed. I believe you are a man
of wisdom and intelligence. This offer I make to you is based on utmost
good faith. I could be Jeopardizing my position in the agency if a word of
this goes out. Therefore, without mincing words, I rely on you for utmost
confidentiality on every bit of detail relating to this transaction. I am
in London on official duties at the moment waiting for your response. Upon
your positive response, I will be willing to forward to you proof of my
proposition and my personal identity. Also, I shall fly back to Sao Tome
and Principe and from there we shall commence operations. I shall also
provide you details of the former license operator and a copy of the
license issued to him for the lifting of crude oil in our company which I
personally approved and endorsed. Also, procedures for license
reassignment and actualizing the rest of the project shall be provided to
you.
=A0
Please in response to this email:

LIFTING LICENSE NO: ANP-C-STP/056432.=20
