Good Day, 

I am Attorney Sir. Caleb Boris Esq; I have an urgent and very profitable 
business proposition for you that should be 
handled with extreme confidentiality. 

SUBJECT: A deceased Client of mine ( names withheld) citizen of your Country whom here in shall be referred to 
as my client, made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months 
valued at US$15, 500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred thousand United States Dollars) Only in a 
bank here. 

My client was a Consultant, and contractor with the South African, Solid Minerals Corporation (SSMC).Upon 
maturity the bank has sent a routine notification in accordance with the Company policy to his forwarding address 
but got no reply. After a month they sent a reminder and finally it was 
discovered from his contract employers South Africa, Solid Minerals Corporation (SSMC) that My Client, his wife 
and two children died in a plane crash,On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will 
and all attempts to trace his next of Kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that my client did not declare any next of Kin or relations in the Deposit paperwork with the bank. However no one will come forward to claim it according to The Government Law as provided in section 129 sub 63(N), Banking Edit of 1961 at the expiration of 9 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Government, if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin and beneficiary 
of my deceased client so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$15.5million can be paid to you, so we can 
share the amount on a mutually agreed percentage of 45% for me 45% for you and 10% for any charity organization 
in your Country. All legal documents to back up your claim as the deceased Next of Kin will be provided by me. 
Your urgent response will be highly appreciated to avoid making further contacts. 
Kind Regards 
Attorney Sir, 
Caleb Boris Esq
