+ * PDSM Envelope:

+ * by 'nd_pdsm_cmd_pkg.payload_offset'. *

+ *
+ * PDSM Header:
+ *
+ * The header is defined as 'struct nd_pdsm_cmd_pkg' which embeds a
+ * 'struct nd_cmd_pkg' instance. The PDSM command is assigned to member
+ * 'nd_cmd_pkg.nd_command'. Apart from size information of the envelope which is
+ * contained in 'struct nd_cmd_pkg', the header also has members following
+ * members:
+ *
+ * 'cmd_status'		: (Out) Errors if any encountered while servicing PDSM.
+ * 'payload_version'	: (In/Out) Version number associated with the payload.
+ * 'payload_offset'	: (In)Relative offset of payload from start of envelope.
+ *
+ * PDSM Payload:
+ *
+ * The layout of the PDSM Payload is defined by various structs shared between
+ * papr_scm and libndctl so that contents of payload can be interpreted. During
+ * servicing of a PDSM the papr_scm module will read input args from the payload
+ * field by casting its contents to an appropriate struct pointer based on the
+ * PDSM command. Similarly the output of servicing the PDSM command will be
+ * copied to the payload field using the same struct.
+ *
+ * 'libnvdimm' enforces a hard limit of 256 bytes on the envelope size, which
+ * leaves around 184 bytes for the envelope payload (ignoring any padding that
+ * the compiler may silently introduce).
+ *
+ * Payload Version:
+ *
+ * A 'payload_version' field is present in PDSM header that indicates a specific
+ * version of the structure present in PDSM Payload for a given PDSM command.
+ * This provides backward compatibility in case the PDSM Payload structure
+ * evolves and different structures are supported by 'papr_scm' and 'libndctl'.
+ *
+ * When sending a PDSM Payload to 'papr_scm', 'libndctl' should send the version
+ * of the payload struct it supports via 'payload_version' field. The 'papr_scm'
+ * module when servicing the PDSM envelope checks the 'payload_version' and then
+ * uses 'payload struct version' == MIN('payload_version field',
+ * 'max payload-struct-version supported by papr_scm') to service the PDSM.
+ * After servicing the PDSM, 'papr_scm' put the negotiated version of payload
+ * struct in returned 'payload_version' field.
+ *
+ * Libndctl on receiving the envelope back from papr_scm again checks the
+ * 'payload_version' field and based on it use the appropriate version dsm
+ * struct to parse the results.
+ *
+ * Backward Compatibility:
+ *
+ * Above scheme of exchanging different versioned PDSM struct between libndctl
+ * and papr_scm should provide backward compatibility until following two
+ * assumptions/conditions when defining new PDSM structs hold:
+ *
+ * Let T(X) = { set of attributes in PDSM struct 'T' versioned X }
+ *
+ * 1. T(X) is a proper subset of T(Y) if X > Y.
+ *    i.e Each new version of PDSM struct should retain existing struct
+ *    attributes from previous version
+ *
+ * 2. If an entity (libndctl or papr_scm) supports a PDSM struct T(X) then
+ *    it should also support T(1), T(2)...T(X - 1).
+ *    i.e When adding support for new version of a PDSM struct, libndctl
+ *    and papr_scm should retain support of the existing PDSM struct
+ *    version they support.
