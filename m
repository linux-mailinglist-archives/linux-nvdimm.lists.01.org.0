Esteemed Compliments,


I anticipate that you read this mail quickly and let me know your 
opinion or willingness on this classified information that I will 
release to you. Firstly, I am a happily married man with 3 kids 
and therefore I would not want to jeopardize this opportunity to 
change my financial status that will give my family a secured 
future.

I am Mr. Daniel Hendricks , the Branch Manager of an Investment  
Bank  in Istanbul  I am 46 years of age. It may interest you to 
hear that I am a man of PEACE and don't want problem, but I don't 
know how you will feel about this, but I am telling you that this 
is real and you are not going to regret after doing this 
transaction with me . 

I only hope we can assist each other. But if you don't want this 
business offer kindly forget it.
I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of 
us, as the Branch Manager of Bank here in  Istanbul  it is my 
duty to send in a financial report to my head office in the  city 
of Istanbul  at the end of each year. On the course of the last 
two years 2017 end of the year report, I discovered that my 
branch in which I am the Manager made eighteen Million Seven 
Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars [$18,750.000.00] 
which my head office are not aware of and will never be aware of, 
Nor must they know that I am involved in this transaction.


I have since place this fund on what we call SUSPENSE ACCOUNT 
without any beneficiary. 

As an officer of the Bank I cannot be directly connected to this 
money, so this is why i have to contact you for us to work so 
that you can assist receive this money into your bank account for 
us to SHARE, Meanwhile you will have 35% of the total fund and 5% 
for expenses incurred during the process of the transaction and 
60% for me Note there are practically no risk involved, it will 
be bank to bank transfer, all I need from you is to stand claim 
as the original depositor of this fund who made the deposit with 
our branch so that my Head office can order the transfer to your 
designated bank account.

If you accept this offer to work with me, I will appreciate it 
very much. As soon as I receive your kind response, I will give 
you details on how we can achieve it successfully.

Please contact me via this E-mail (e.babaeai@gmail.com) for more 
details.

Best Regards,

Mr.Daniel Hendricks

Branch Manager,
